!      ==========================================================
!      NOTE: If you're looking here for things to customize, look
!      on the Preferences dialogs under the Options menu first.
!      Most things are customizable from there.  Things which are
!      settable via the Preferences dialog boxes are stored in
!      the ~/.netscape/preferences file, and not in X resources.
!      ==========================================================
!
! This file lists the default resources built in to Netscape.
! You can use the stuff in this file for examples of how to customize
! Netscape for your environment; normally you will do this by
! copying the few lines you want to alter to your private resource
! database, which usually lives in a file called .Xdefaults in your home
! directory.
!
! Site administrators **may** want to make changes here and install this
! file as the global app-defaults file for the site.  To do this, one
! would copy this file to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Netscape, or on SunOS,
! /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Netscape.  (But actually this directory
! could be anywhere; only the person who installed X knows for sure.)
!
! It is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you not install this file in the
! app-defaults directory unless you are really sure you know what you are
! doing.  There are a whole slew of version-skew problems associated with
! app-defaults files, which are best avoided by simply not using them.
! In particular, if the app-defaults file for a program is installed, and
! you get a new version of that program, you can't properly test out the
! new version without actually installing it, since it will pick up the
! resources for the previous version, and will quite likely malfunction.
!
! In short, app-defaults files are bad.  Don't use them.  This file is
! provided for informational purposes, and so that I don't get a lot of
! complaints from people who think they understand this stuff better than
! I do.

! This resource is the same as the -visual command line option, which selects
! an X visual on which the windows should be created.  Legal options are:
! Best, meaning pick the best one w.r.t. image quality; Default, meaning
! use whatever the server says is the default visual; a visual class (like
! PseudoColor or TrueColor); or a decimal or hexadecimal digit, the ID of
! a particular visual (in case there is more than one visual of a particular
! class.)  "Best" is probably the right choice.
!
*visualID:			Best

! Whether Netscape should install a private colormap.  This will cause the
! maximal number of colors to be used, but on most systems, will result in
! unpleasant colormap flashing when switching between applications.  Legal
! options are: Yes, No, and Guess.  "Guess" means "install the colormap only
! if we know that the display hardware supports multiple simultaneous
! colormaps, meaning that there will be no colormap flashing."  Currently,
! that means install the map when displaying on an SGI screen, and don't
! otherwise.  (What other vendors have multiple hardware colormaps, and how
! do you uniquely identify that capability?  Let me know.)
!
*installColormap:		Guess

! Some motif versions have a XmDragOverShell (called "dragOver")
! widget which has a XmNinstallColormap resource.  Force it to false here
! so that there is no conflict with the "*installColormap: Guess" stuff.
*dragOver*installColormap:		False

! The maximum number of color cells to allocate per image; this is only
! relevant when using the default colormap of a PseudoColor visual.
! If it is 0, we allocate as many colors as we can get.  (The more colors
! that we can allocate, the better images will look.)  This controls only
! the number of colors allocated for internal images - a few more colors
! will be allocated for the fluff and chrome that comes with Motif.
!
*maxImageColors:		0

! Set this to false to disable the <BLINK> tag.
*blinkingEnabled:		True

! Whether the Exit menu item should confirm first.
*confirmExit:			False

! Mouse cursor when over an anchor.
*linkCursor:			hand2

! Mouse cursor when awaiting a reply.
*busyCursor:			watch

! Mouse cursor when "Save Next Link As..." mode is on, and over a link.
*saveNextLinkCursor:		hand2

! Mouse cursor when "Save Next Link As..." mode is on, and not over a link.
*saveNextNonlinkCursor:		crosshair

! How quickly (in seconds) the status messages should update.
*progressInterval:		1

! How quickly (in milliseconds) the run light and/or logo should animate.

! How often (in seconds) the global history, bookmarks, and disk cache
! files should be updated.
*saveHistoryInterval:		600

! How many pixels of motion must occur before a mouse-release is interpreted
! as a "drag" rather than a "click."
*hysteresis:			3

! These resources control whether Netscape should redirect its stdout and
! stderr streams to a dialog box, so that diagnostics reported by other
! programs launched by Netscape (for example, external viewers specified in
! a mailcap file) will be reported to the user through a dialog box,
! instead of simply showing up on the stdout/stderr of the controlling
! terminal of Netscape (which in many cases won't even be visible.)
!
! If you have a external viewer which produces an annoying amount of output
! even when it has nothing interesting to say, you can shut it up by
! redirecting its output to stderr; for example, to do this to mpeg_play,
! you could add the following to your .mailcap file:
!
!        video/mpeg; mpeg_play %s 2>&-
!
! Normally, Netscape captures both the stdout and stderr into the dialog box.
! If you find a need to let one or both of them continue on to the actual
! terminal of Netscape, you can do it by setting these resources to False.
!
!*useStderrDialog:		True
!*useStdoutDialog:		True
*useStderrDialog:               False
*useStdoutDialog:               False

! For those MIME content-encodings which are not directly understood
! internally, it is possible to specify another Unix program to use as
! a filter here.
!
! Each line in the encodingFilters resource consists of four fields,
! separated by colons and optional whitespace:
!
!   <input-encoding>  : <output-encoding> : <extensions> : <filter-command>
!
! input-encoding:  The MIME encoding from the Content-Transfer-Encoding header.
!                  (The basic encodings 7BIT, 8BIT, BINARY, BASE64, and QUOTED-
!                  PRINTABLE are built-in; no need to specify those.)
!
! output-encoding: The encoding that results from this transformation.
!                  Leaving this empty is usually appropriate.
!
! extensions:      A comma-separated list of the extensions typically used for
!                  files in this encoding; if a document ends in one of these
!                  extensions, then when that document is saved to disk, the
!                  extension will be stripped off of the default file name
!                  (since documents are decoded before they are saved, and the
!                  extension would no longer accurately describe the file.)
!
! filter-command:  A shell command which reads from stdin and writes to stdout
!                  which does the actual decoding.
!

! Too many servers have bugs in the implementation of window gravity for
! us to rely on it.  Scrolling of large forms is *significantly* faster
! if we are able to make use of window gravity, but on many X servers, it
! results in form items being scattered randomly all over the document.
! Legal values for this resource are Yes, No, Partial, and Guess.  If
! "Guess", we run some tests and try to decide whether the X server is
! broken or partially broken.
!
! If you find yourself needing to use a value here other than Guess,
! please tell us, so that we can make it guess correctly in the future.
!
*windowGravityWorks:		Guess


! By default, the geometries of components (browsers, mail, address book, etc)
! are saved in ~/.netscape/preferences.js.  If this pisses you off, uncomment
! the following line and Netscape will not remember component geometries.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-dont-save-geometry-prefs' startup flag.
!
!*dontSaveGeometryPrefs:		True


! Uncomment the following line to ignore any geometry preferences that
! might have been saved.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-ignore-geometry-prefs' startup flag.
!
!*ignoreGeometryPrefs:			True


! Uncomment the following line to bypass the startup licence page.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-no-about-splash' startup flag.
!
!*noAboutSplash:				True

! Netscape supports session management by default.  Uncomment the following
! line to force it off.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-session-management'
!                         '-no-session-management' startup flags.
!
!*sessionManagement:			False


! Different platforms deal with session management in fundamentally
! different ways.  Toggle this resource if you experience session
! management problems.
!
! IRIX session management is on by default only on SGI systems.  It is also
! available on other platforms and might work with session managers other
! than the IRIX desktop.  To use session management as the IRIX desktop
! expects it, uncomment the following line.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-irix-session-management'
!                         '-no-irix-session-management' startup flags.
!
*irixSessionManagement:			True


! Uncomment the following line to ignore the alwaysraised, alwayslowered,
! and z-lock JavaScript window.open() attributes.  By default,  Netscape will
! try to force the window stacking to match these attributes.  If you think
! this is the ultimate fascism, uncomment the following line.
!
! Equivalent to using the '-dont-force-window-stacking' startup flag.
!
!*dontForceWindowStacking:		True


! Colors
!
! This resource controls the foreground text color of unfollowed links 
! (links which have not yet been visited.)
!
*linkForeground:			#0000FF

! This resource controls the foreground text color of followed links 
! (links which have already been visited.)
!
*vlinkForeground:			#990066

! This resource controls the foreground text color of activated links 
! (links which are in the process of being clicked upon.)
!
*alinkForeground:			#FF0000

! These resources control the foreground and background colors of text
! which has been selected with the mouse.
!
*selectForeground:			#000000
*selectBackground:			#FFFFCC

! These resources control the foreground and background colors of normal text.
!
*defaultForeground:			#000000
*defaultBackground:			#C0C0C0

! This resource may be used to specify a default background image.  It should
! be a file name or URL pointing to a GIF, JPEG, or XBM image.  If it is blank,
! then the default background color will be used instead.
!
*defaultBackgroundImage:		

! Normally, the user-specified colors and backgrounds will only be used when
! viewing documents which did not specify their own colors and backgrounds.
! If this resource is set to False, then the user-specified colors and
! backgrounds will always be used, regardless of the options specified in 
! the document itself.
!
*documentColorsHavePriority:		True


! Geometry
!
! Here's how you set the default sizes and positions of the Netscape windows:
!
! For the web browser window:   Netscape.Navigator.geometry: =500x700+100-0
! For the mail reader:          Netscape.Mail.geometry: =500x800+200-0
! For the news reader:          Netscape.News.geometry: =500x800+300-0
! For the mail editor:          Netscape.Composition.geometry: =400x600
! For the bookmarks window:     Netscape.Bookmarks.geometry: =300x900-0-0
! For the address book window:  Netscape.AddressBook.geometry: =600x900-300-0
! For the download windows:     Netscape.Download.geometry: =500x200-0-0
!
! In previous versions of Netscape, we suggested setting the geometry on the
! TopLevelShell class; don't do that any more.  It will affect *all* of the
! top-level Netscape windows, including bookmarks and message composition and
! so on, which is probably not what you want.
!
! To set the sizes of the panes and columns in the mail and news windows, 
! change them to the layout you like, and then select "Options/Save Options".
! (To change the fonts in the message lists, search below for the resource
! that begins with "XmLGrid*fontList".)



! Translations
!
! Many of these translations are duplicated on both "Meta" and "Alt", since
! X has this stupid notion that "Meta" and "Alt" are not synonymous, and
! Sun in their infinite wisdom furthers this confusing lossage by both having
! Meta *and* Alt keys on the keyboard, and having the key which is labelled
! Alt generate *META* (the Diamond keys generate Alt.)  All praise Sun!
! All praise the X keyboard model!
!
! And because of the need to do this, we have to do all of the keyboard
! equivalents with "translations" instead of "accelerators", since a menu
! item can only have one accelerator, and in order to make both Meta and Alt
! work we need to give them each two.  All praise Motif!


! Keybindings in the main window which correspond to menu items.
! These are installed on every widget which is a child of our Shell,
! and are not installed on popups/transients.

! Some basic emacs-like bindings for text fields.
!
! "editingTranslations" are merged into all XmText and XmTextField widgets.
! Then, either "multiLinEditingTranslations" or "singleLinEditingTranslations"
! are merged in, depending on whether it is an XmText or XmTextField widget.
! These resources are merged in after "globalTranslations", so it is possible
! for them to override the menu accelerators.
!
! Problems:
!  = I don't understand why the "Ctrl<Key>g" binding does nothing.
!  = I wish things like `C-k C-k C-k C-n C-k C-k C-y' did the right thing.
!  = This doesn't quite do active regions right, in that C-SPC M-f doesn't
!    leave the word highlighted (though it does leave a region set.)
! Basically, XmText is not Emacs, and we therefore exist in a world of pain.
!
!  NOTE: if you're looking here because BackSpace and Delete aren't
!        working the way you think they should, then you need to run
!        xmodmap or xkeycaps to fix your keyboard, or mess read the man
!        page for VirtualBindings(1).  For details, see the Netscape FAQ
!        (available from the Help menu.)

! Translations that apply only to single-line fields; see above.
!
! Ctrl-U clears the current line only in single-line fields.  Unix
! command-line weenies expect this, even though everyone knows Ctrl-U
! should mean "prefix argument".
!
! In single-line fields, the various killing commands are really deletion
! commands instead (that is, they don't affect the Clipboard and are not
! undoable with Ctrl-y) because the XmTextField widget does not provide
! kill commands -- only the XmText widget does.  (What the hell is up with
! that...)  Maybe we could get around this by never using XmTextField, and
! only using XmText with editMode set to SINGLE_LINE_EDIT, but that might
! have other unexpected effects...
!
! I thought of making Meta-d be `set-anchor() forward-word() cut-clipboard()',
! but that doesn't work, because forward-word takes the whitespace after the
! word as well, instead of stopping before the whitespace.
!
! Similarly, Ctrl-k can't be implemented with
! `set-anchor() end-of-line(extend) cut-clipboard() delete-selection()'
! because that has the side effect of (temporarily) owning the selection,
! which would make it impossible to: select text in another application;
! type C-k at Netscape; Click middle to paste.  The paste would be impossible
! because C-k would have cleared the selection.

! About Translations, Actions, and "-remote" commands:
!
! You can control a running Netscape process externally; you do this by
! issuing a command like "netscape -remote openURL(http://xxx)".
! When Netscape is invoked with the -remote argument, it does not open
! window, but instead connects to and controls an already-existing process.
! This is done using X properties, so the two Netscape processes need not
! be running on the same machine, and need not share a file system.
!
! All of Netscape's action names are the same as its resource names; so, for
! example, if you wanted to know the name of the action that corresponds to
! the "Add Bookmark" menu item, you could look in this file for "Add Bookmark"
! and see that the resource that is set to that string is "addBookmark" -
! that's the name of the Action as well.
!
! You can use Actions in Translation tables in the usual Xt-ish way, but you
! can also invoke them directly via "netscape -remote", like this:
!
!    netscape -remote 'addBookmark()'
!
! That will cause the existing Netscape process to add its current URL to
! the bookmarks, just as if you had selected that menu item.
!
! Please see the document http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html
! for more information.

! This is 72 rather than 79 or 80 because the width of the window controls
! when word wrapping should occur; the Motif text area has no mechanism for
! wrapping at a column other than the last one.  So, if we want a fill-column
! of N, the window must be N wide.  Note that wrapping must occur before 80:
! sending out lines with 80 characters on them is antisocial, as many programs
! and terminals (including emacs) can only display 79 characters without 
! wrapping.  Wrapping at 72 is better than wrapping at 79 because it leaves
! room for further followups to quote the lines with ">" without causing
! lines to wrap.
!
! Note that, in the composition window, lines beginning with ">" will not
! be wrapped at all, despite the appearance on the screen.  So just because
! it looks like the quoted text has been mangled, doesn't mean it has.

! Need class name in here to defeat *sgiMode and HP-VUE color nonsense...
! On SGIs, not having the class will cause the default SGI colors to
! be used instead of the ones specified here.  With VUE, the behavior
! is even worse - if we're using a non-default visual (for example, if
! we have requested a 24-bit TrueColor visual instead of the default
! 8-bit PseudoColor) then VUE will ignore the fact that we're not using
! the default visual, and give us colors allocated from the wrong
! colormap, resulting in lovely effects like brown-on-brown menubars!
!
! (Note: if you comment this stuff out in an attempt to let the current
! "scheme" override things, you'll find that the colors of the toolbar
! icons and the colors of form elements (like option menus) will get
! messed up.)
